## Database Analysis and Optimization

This repository contains a collection of queries and analyses designed to extract valuable insights from a database for both operational and executive-level decision-making. The aim of this project is to help manage store operations efficiently and optimize revenue by identifying key performance indicators and areas of improvement.

## Operational Level Analysis
The operational level analysis provides information that aids day-to-day operations and store management. It includes the following functionalities:

- Customer Contribution: Queries have been created to identify customers who contribute the most sales. This information can assist in understanding customer behaviour and developing targeted marketing strategies.

- CD Returns: By utilizing the database, queries have been developed to determine the number of CDs that need to be returned. This feature facilitates effective inventory management and ensures customer satisfaction.

## Executive Level Analysis

The executive-level analysis focuses on providing a broader perspective of the business by presenting sales data categorized by various dimensions. It includes the following functionalities:

- District Sales: Queries have been designed to showcase sales figures for each district. This allows for a better understanding of regional performance and helps identify potential growth or improvement areas.

- Sales by Staff and Month: The database queries provide insights into sales performance based on staff members and months. This information enables tracking of individual and team contributions and helps identify trends and patterns over time.

- Film Analysis: Detailed queries have been developed to analyze film-related data. This includes identifying the films that generate the highest sales based on actor and rating, determining the number of rentals grouped by language, and evaluating special features to identify movies with rental rates above the average. These insights aid in determining the demand for different types of films and optimizing the inventory selection.

## Revenue Optimization
To optimize revenue, an assumption has been made regarding the depreciation recall period, which is set at 10 times after rental. By analyzing the data, the most profitable category of movies has been identified, providing guidance for revenue optimization strategies.
